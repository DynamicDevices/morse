# morse
Morse code encoding and decoding

Python based development code to begin to work out how to implement morse decoding

morse_win.py - windows based code that takes a message on the command line, writes it to a file beeping for dots/dashes, then reads the file back to parse

morse.py - embedded code that will be used on MicroPython (e.g. ESP8266)
